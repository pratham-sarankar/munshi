# Dark Mode and Light Mode Implementation

This document describes the implementation of dark mode and light mode functionality using Provider state management.

## Features Implemented

1. **Provider State Management**: Uses the `provider` package to manage theme state across the app
2. **Theme Persistence**: Saves user's theme preference using `shared_preferences`
3. **UI Toggle**: Added functional theme dropdown in Settings screen
4. **Three Theme Options**:
   - Light: Always use light theme
   - Dark: Always use dark theme  
   - Auto: Follow system theme preference

## Files Modified

### 1. `pubspec.yaml`
- Added `provider: ^6.1.2` for state management
- Added `shared_preferences: ^2.3.2` for persistence

### 2. `lib/providers/theme_provider.dart` (New)
- `ThemeProvider` class extends `ChangeNotifier`
- Manages `ThemeMode` state (light, dark, system)
- Provides methods to change theme and persist preferences
- Loads saved theme preference on app startup

### 3. `lib/main.dart`
- Wrapped app with `ChangeNotifierProvider<ThemeProvider>`
- Used `Consumer<ThemeProvider>` to rebuild when theme changes
- Connected `themeMode` property to provider state

### 4. `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`
- Replaced local `_selectedTheme` state with provider consumption
- Used `Consumer<ThemeProvider>` for theme dropdown
- Added haptic feedback when theme changes
- Connected dropdown changes to `themeProvider.setThemeMode()`

### 5. Tests
- Added `test/theme_provider_test.dart` with comprehensive unit tests
- Updated `test/widget_test.dart` to work with the new app structure

## How It Works

1. **App Startup**: `ThemeProvider` loads saved theme from `SharedPreferences`
2. **Theme Change**: User selects new theme in Settings → Provider updates state → App rebuilds with new theme
3. **Persistence**: Theme choice is automatically saved to device storage
4. **State Management**: Provider pattern ensures all screens reflect theme changes instantly

## Usage

Users can change the theme by:
1. Opening the app
2. Navigating to Settings (bottom tab)
3. Tapping the Theme dropdown
4. Selecting Light, Dark, or Auto

The change is applied immediately and persisted across app restarts.

## Technical Benefits

- **Minimal Changes**: Leveraged existing theme infrastructure in `core/theme.dart`
- **Clean Architecture**: Separated theme logic into dedicated provider
- **Performance**: Only rebuilds UI when theme actually changes
- **User Experience**: Instant theme switching with haptic feedback
- **Accessibility**: Supports system theme preferences (Auto mode)
